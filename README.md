This project aims to create a comprehensive **Learning Management System** integrating students, teachers, parents, and other stakeholders information into a single, accessible web-based entity.

It was a part of my *April to August 2023* long holiday projects within my ongoing journey of learning Frontend Web Development. While I had a strong desire to complete it, unfortunately, the project proved to be resource-intensive, especially in terms of time, which was quite limited back then. I remain hopeful that one of these days, I'll return full force to pick up from where I left off.

The process of creating this project was enjoyable, particularly in establishing links between different models with diverse relationships, such as *Many-to-Many*, *One-to-Many*, and *One-to-One*, thanks to [**SQLAlchemy**](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/).

## Achievements

During the development of this project, I was concurrently working on [Youtube-Blog](https://github.com/Simatwa/Youtube-Blog), a blogging app specifically tailored for *Youtubers*, targeting mobile users. This project turned out to be a significant success within my web development journey.

## Long-Term Goal

1. My ultimate aspiration is to witness a fully complete version of this project before eternity.

## Contributions

Currently, I'm not accepting contributions directly. However, forking this repository and making progress from there is always encouraged. If you manage to create a complete version, please notify me so that we can celebrate this achievement together.

## Special Thanks

- [x] A heartfelt thank you to my caring mom, **Sarah**, who always ensured I had enough time for coding despite the numerous chores I was supposed to perform.
  
- [x] I extend my gratitude to my understanding girlfriend, **Eunice**, for her constant motivation and patience with my late replies and late-night calls.

## Disclaimer

This project is incomplete, so expect some bugs to some extent.
